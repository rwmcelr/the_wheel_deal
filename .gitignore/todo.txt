Next steps:
* let's exclude the first and last open spaces on each arc array - this should create a nice margin for all of the text
* let's also restrict the arc closest to the center of the circle from having any characters added - this should prevent text from becoming unreadable super close to the center (cutoff from the spin button and too much tightening in general) before sizing down
* Also, I'm not sure why we're having so much trouble centering this, in my mind it should be simple:
- We have the center point (center angle)
- We have the start and end points (start angle + distance from centered accounted for, end angle + distance from centered accounted for)
- We can calculate this arc length and the space characters take up
- How is it still offset, how is it being offset differently between different slice conditions (the math should work out every time, regardless of how many slices), and why won't the text for the first slices (1-3 depending on number of slices) show up properly?

- looks better/worse on different numbers of slices
- retool small label logic to look better
-- character # cutoff for small > large label is when it no longer looks off center when it switches

- fix early slice text being cutoff
- fix 2 slice text being entirely wrong
- fix inconsistent border
- fix vertically stacking box inputs
